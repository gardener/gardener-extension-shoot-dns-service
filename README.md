Project Gardener implements the automated management and operation of [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) clusters as a service. Its main principle is to leverage Kubernetes concepts for all of its tasks.

Recently, most of the vendor specific logic has been developed [in-tree](https://github.com/gardener/gardener). However, the project has grown to a size where it is very hard to extend, maintain, and test. With [GEP-1](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/docs/proposals/01-extensibility.md) we have proposed how the architecture can be changed in a way to support external controllers that contain their very own vendor specifics. This way, we can keep Gardener core clean and independent.

## Extension-Resources

Example extension resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1
kind: Extension
metadata:
  name: "extension-dns-service"
  namespace: shoot--project--abc
spec:
  type: shoot-dns-service
```

## How to start using or developing this extension controller locally

You can run the controller locally on your machine by executing `make start`. Please make sure to have the kubeconfig to the cluster you want to connect to ready in the `./dev/kubeconfig` file.
Static code checks and tests can be executed by running `make verify`. We are using Go modules for Golang package dependency management and [Ginkgo](https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo)/[Gomega](https://github.com/onsi/gomega) for testing.
